JavaScript is _weakly typed_ programming language, used both for frontend and backend development, and compiled at runtime (_JIT_ compilation).

A JavaScript code can be exectuted on a Web Browser or in a Web Server, by using a _JavaScript Engine_. The most popular JavaScript engine is used in Google Chrome, and known as _V8_.

## History

JavaScript was born in 1995 when _Netscape_, one of the first Web Browser adopted _LiveScript_ (this is the initial name of JavaScript, however later due the popularity of Java it was renamed in this way). In 1996, Microsoft adopt JavaScript for the first version of Internet Explorer, and JavaScript starting to gain popularity.

However, only the late of 1996 JavaScript started its standardizazion process, by submitting to _ECMA_ (European Computer Manufactures Association) Internalization. One year later, the first version of _ECMAScript_ was released, and JavaScript is the most famous implementation of this language.

Between 2006 and 2011 huge progresses in JavaScript standardization were made, and finally Microsoft supported the standardization process.

Finally, in 2009 the first version of JavaScript outside a web browser was released, and soon it would be known as _Node.js_. Nowadays, Javascript is the most populare languages for frontend development, and one of the most importat in backend.
