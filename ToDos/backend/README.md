# Backend

As we mentioned before, JavaScript can also be runned outside a Web Browser, in fact, if we consider Google Chrome, it executes JavaScript inside an interpreter known as `V8`, therefore, back in 2009, some developers understand that is possible to run JavaScript also outside a browser just exporting the JavaScript engine in another environment. That is, `Node.js` was born.

We will not talk about Node.js in a deeper way, moreover we will have just a quick look about it, since we are interested in develop a backend service for out final project.

There are some tools that we are going to use to develop this simple service, first of all we will use `Express.js`, a JavaScript backend framework used to API more quickly and in an easier way.
